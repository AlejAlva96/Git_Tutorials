*********** GITHUB ************
1. Create account
2. Create repository
3. Create file/ edit file -> Commit file
4. Create branch (Copy of the master repo and in this brach create new code)
5. Once created, make a pull request to upload the changes to the master
6. GitHub via command line (GitBash): 
6.1 Activate ssh public and private key
6.2 Create new repo in GitHub
6.3 Follow the next steps:
$cd Downloads
$mkdir demo_test1
$cd demo_test1
-To create a readmd file use echo "# demo1" >> README.md
-Initialize the directory git init
-Create and add a README.md file. You can use a normal text editor depending on which OS you are using. git add README.md
-Check the status of the file git status
-Commit the changes git commit -m "first commit"
-Add the origin where we have to push the file. This is the SSHRepositoryLink you copied when you created the repository. git remote add origin git@github.com:mskill/demo1.git
-Push the file git push -u origin master
PUSH is to send our changes from the remote repository (Git Bash) to the GitHub
PULL is to receive the files from the GitHub
7. To create a branch from the remote terminal (Git Bash): $git branch name_of_branch
8. To set this branch as branch to use: $git checkout mybranch
When make $git status, you will see than now we are using the branch created called mybranch instead of the master branch
9. To create a file in a branch from terminal and include some text do:
$echo "# Extract of code on this branch" >> script.py
After that, make the git add script.py and the $git commit -m "Message in the commit"
10. Para pasar los datos de un branch al master:
10.1 Nos ponemos en el master: $git checkout master
10.2 Introduce the next command: $git merge branch_to_merge
